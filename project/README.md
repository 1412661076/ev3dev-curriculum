This folder is for the course final project code. Students should create a self-selected project that demonstrates their understanding of ev3-python. The goal is to have a little fun and have a little freedom to pick a project that is interesting to you.  Create a folder for your work if you have a lot of modules in your project, or simply create a file in this folder for your project code.
